🚀 About Me

I am a Business Analytics postgraduate student at the University of Greenwich, with a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am transitioning into analytics-driven roles by combining technical skills, business understanding, and real-world project experience.

I am particularly interested in:
⦁	Data-driven decision making
⦁	Business intelligence and reporting
⦁	Predictive and sustainability analytics
⦁	Ethical and responsible use of data

I am actively building industry-ready skills to secure a Business Analyst / Data Analyst role immediately after completing my master’s degree.
